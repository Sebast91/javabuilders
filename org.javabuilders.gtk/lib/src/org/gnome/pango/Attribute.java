/**
 * A (single) specific formatting or font to be applied to a range of Text.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Examples of setting up Attributes include:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * attr = new StyleAttribute(Style.ITALIC);
 * </pre>
 * 
 * although many settings can be compounded by setting a FontDescription:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * desc = new FontDescription(&quot;DejaVu Serif, 9pt&quot;);
 * attr = new FontDescriptionAttribute(desc);
 * </pre>
 * 
 * in general it's one Attribute per characteristic. You then aggregate these
 * together in an AttributeList and then apply them to a Layout. See
 * {@link AttributeList} for an example of using these on discrete parts of
 * text.
 * 
 * <p>
 * <b>WARNING</b>:<br>
 * When coding with Attributes be aware of the following restrictions:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Once you have assigned an Attribute to a specific range of text in a
 * given Layout you must not attempt to reuse it.
 * 
 * <li>Once you have inserted an Attribute into an AttributeList it is
 * "consumed" by that list and you must not attempt to reuse it.
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>
 * <i> The different text attribute manipulations you can do are analogous to
 * those found on FontDescription and TextTag. Indeed, Pango's Attributes are
 * is the underlying mechanism powering TextView and Label's rendering of rich
 * markup.</i>
 * 
 * 
 * <p>
 * <i>Pango Attributes have an internal ugliness which is that each one needs
 * to be told the offsets of text it applies to. The problem is that these are
 * in terms of UTF-8 bytes, which not something we have access to from Java
 * (nor would we want to expose such in our public API). We take care of
 * setting the start and end points properly when you call</i>
 * {@link Layout#setAttributes(AttributeList) setAttributes()}<i>, but you
 * have to have already set the text into the Layout for us to be able to do
 * so, obviously.</i>
