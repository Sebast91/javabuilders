ATK is the toolkit that GNOME uses to enable accessibility for users needing
extra support to make the most of their computers. ATK is used by tools such as
screen readers, magnifiers, and input devices to permit a rich interaction with
the desktop through alternative means.

<p>
ATK has also been used by testing frameworks as the means to introspect Widgets
and text on the screen allowing the creation of automated function test suites.

<p>
<b>ATK is not yet implemented in java-gnome</b>
