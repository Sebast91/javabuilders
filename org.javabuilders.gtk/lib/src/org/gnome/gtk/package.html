GTK is the widget toolkit which is used by applications to create rich user
interfaces on the screen. See {@link org.gnome.gtk.Gtk Gtk} to get started.

<!-- TODO that's still a rather lame starting reference. -->

<h2>History</h2>

<p>GTK was first created by the authors of <a href="http://www.gimp.org/">The
GIMP</a>, a powerful graphics manipulation program. They had innovative ideas
about the user interface they wanted to provide, but needed to create an
entirely new widget toolkit to do so!</p>

<p>The result was GTK (the <b><u>G</u></b>IMP widget <b><u>T</u></b>ool
<b><u>K</u></b>it). Many liked its power, look and feel, and simplicity, and
very quickly it became the foundation of the GNOME project and today is used
not only for all the applications that make up the GNOME Desktop, but for a
huge range of popular programs available for Linux and Unix.</p>

<p>Originally GTK was a self contained library, but as it became the
foundation for GNOME it was abstracted into several layers which are reflected
in the many packages that are available in java-gnome; if you haven't already,
see the <a href="../../../overview-summary.html">overview</a> for details.</p>
